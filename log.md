# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2018-05-23

**Today's Progress**: Went through Chapter 3 of Head First HTML and CSS: Building Blocks: Web Page Construction (57:30 mins)

**Thoughts:**: I don't even know how to publish this on the web yet. Github pages?

**Link to work:** file:///Users/chiaracokieng/Downloads/hfhtmlcss/chapter3/journal/chapter3.html -- it's just in my personal computer.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
